# Workforce Productivity & Burnout Risk Analysis (Excel Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses workforce productivity and burnout risk using Microsoft Excel. The objective is to understand how workload, rest hours, and commute time impact employee productivity and burnout levels across different job roles. The analysis is designed to support management decision-making rather than just visual reporting.

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset is a synthetic but realistic workforce dataset created for analytical demonstration purposes. It includes:
- Employee roles
- Daily work hours
- Commute hours
- Sleep and leisure hours
- Productivity scores

Derived metrics include:
- Total workload hours
- Rest hours
- Burnout risk index
- Work-life ratio

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data cleaning and structuring
- Calculated fields using formulas
- Pivot Tables for role-based aggregation
- Pivot Charts for visual analysis
- KPI-based dashboard design
- Business insight generation

---

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed
- Average burnout risk by job role
- Average productivity score by job role
- Relationship between workload, rest, and productivity
- Identification of roles with high productivity but elevated burnout risk

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- KPI cards for quick management overview
- Burnout Risk by Role (Column Chart)
- Productivity Score by Role (Column Chart)
- Clean, executive-friendly dashboard layout

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Software Engineers exhibit the highest burnout risk while maintaining high productivity, indicating potential sustainability concerns.
- Data Analysts show comparatively lower burnout risk, likely due to more balanced work-rest patterns.
- Increased workload and commute hours contribute to burnout without proportional productivity gains.

---

## 🎯 Business Recommendation
Organizations should consider workload optimization strategies such as flexible working hours and reduced commute burden to maintain productivity while minimizing burnout risk.
